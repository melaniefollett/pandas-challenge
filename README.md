# Analysis of Video Game Purchase Data with Pandas

For this project I analyzed the data for a mock fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli.  Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. I was tasked with generating a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

My final report included informative tables breaking down each of the following:

- Player Count
- Total Number of Players
- Number of Unique Items
- Average Purchase Price
- Total Number of Purchases
- Total Revenue
- Gender Demographics of Purchasers
- Purchasing Analysis by Gender
- Age Demographics of Purchasers
- Top Spenders
- Most Popular Items
- Most Profitable Items

# Final Products
- Jupyter notebook showing code (HeroesofPymoli.ipynb)
- Word document of final report of findings (HeroesofPymoliReport.docx)
